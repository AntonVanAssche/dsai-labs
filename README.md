# Data Science & AI - Labs

This repository contains all my shitty solutions for the lab assignments of the course Data Science & AI at [Ghent University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.hogent.be/en/).
I'm not responsible for brain damage caused by reading this code ðŸ™ƒ.

The repository contains all modules of the course, each in a separate folder, a summary of the course written in Dutch and a folder containing some sample exams.
The folders containing the modules contain Jupiter Notebooks, which are used to explain the theory and to practice data science techniques using Python.

## Getting started

In case you want to run the code, you need to install the following software:

-   Python
-   Visual Studio Code, with extensions:
    -   Python, Pylance (Microsoft)
    -   Jupyter, Jupyter Keymap, Jupyter Notebook Rendering (Microsoft)
-   Optionally: GitLens (GitKraken), Markdown All in One (Yu Zhang)
-   Git & a Github-account

To get started with the code, you need to clone the repository to your local machine.
Afterwards, you can open the repository in Visual Studio Code, which should automatically ask to install all required plugins.

## References

In the lab assignments, there are occasional references to sources. You can find a reference list here:
